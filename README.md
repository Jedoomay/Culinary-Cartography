Culinary Cartography
Culinary Cartography is a data analysis and machine learning project designed to explore global culinary trends, their ingredients, and correlations with socioeconomic factors such as health scores, life expectancy, GDP, and IQ. The project leverages interactive visualizations and a classification model to analyze recipes and predict their regional origins.


Culinary Cartography examines how culinary ingredients vary across regions and explores correlations between recipes and factors such as:

Health scores by region.
Socioeconomic indicators like GDP per capita, IQ, and life expectancy.
Ingredient frequency and network relationships.
The project includes an interactive dashboard and a machine learning model to predict the region of origin for recipes based on their ingredients.
